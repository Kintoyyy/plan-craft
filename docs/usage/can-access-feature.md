# Checking if User Can Access a Specific Feature

In this section, we'll explore how to check if a user can access a specific feature based on their subscription plan using the `canAccessFeature` method.

## Usage

The `canAccessFeature` method verifies whether the user has an active plan and if the specific feature is accessible based on the plan's defined features. Here's an example of how to use it:

```php
$user = auth()->user();

// Check if the user can access the 'createPost' feature
$canAccessFeature = $user->canAccessFeature('create:chirp');
```

## Explanation

The code above get the current authenticated user and then checks if they can access the specified feature using the `canAccessFeature` method. It returns `true` if the user can access the feature, and `false` if they cannot.

## Result

After running the code, the `$canAccessFeature` variable will be `true` if the user can access the 'create:chirp' feature, and `false` if they cannot.
